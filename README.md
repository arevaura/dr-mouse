# Dr. Mouse ü™§

## A Digital Therapist and Journalling Web App

> Do you ever need a space to rant to someone without judgement? Do you like cute animals?  
> 
> Then Dr. Mouse may be just the right therapist for *you*!  

Dr. Mouse is welcoming, understanding, and a great listener overall. With Dr. Mouse, you can log journal entries limitlessly and note how your mood changes with each day. You can also set goals and customize the appearance of the web app.

*Main Features*:
- tracks total number of written entries
- lets users create, edit, and delete entries
- takes in metadata for each entry:
   - entry title
   - date logged
   - mood of the day  
   ... and more!

**What does the application do?**  
This application is a platform that will allow users to express their daily thoughts and feelings. The 'Dr. Mouse' web app will take in and display written entries. Users can log as many entries as they would like. Additionally, they can go back and modify or delete entry contents afterwards. Dr. Mouse will send motivational and encouraging messages to users after each successful log entry.    
`Classes: Journal, Entry`

**Who can use this?**  
This free application is intended for the general public. Netizens can explore the app features freely and at their own leisure.

**Why is this project of interest to me?**  
Since the global pandemic hit a few years ago, people have started to pay greater attention to their emotional well-being. Many have found that they especially lacked social comfort during the lockdown. As a way to remedy some feelings of isolation, this app idea was born to help everyone express themselves without any restrictions or limits. Users can release their pent-up thoughts and feelings with the internet right at your fingertips, and that is why this project is important to me.  
Remember, Dr. Mouse is always only a few mouse-clicks away!

#### Why choose Dr. Mouse?  
Mice are intellectual creatures. Much like us, some prefer to stay close to peers and others prefer solitude. Mice have lots of personality, and are thought to exhibit emotional intelligence and empathy as well.
